### Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze the sales data of Monday Coffee, a company that has been selling its products online since January 2023, and to recommend the top three major cities in India for opening new coffee shop locations based on consumer demand and sales performance.

### Key Questions
#### 1. How many people in each city are estimated to consume coffee, given that 25% of the population does?

```sql
SELECT 
    city_name,
    FORMAT((population * 0.25) / 1000000, '0.0 M') AS coffee_consumers
FROM city
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

#### 2. What is the total revenue generated from coffee sales across all cities in the last quarter of 2023?

```sql
SELECT FORMAT(SUM(total),'#,0') AS last_qtr_23_sales
FROM sales
WHERE DATEPART(quarter,sale_date) = 4
AND YEAR(sale_date) = 2023
```

#### 3. How many units of each coffee product have been sold?

```sql
SELECT p.product_name, COUNT(s.sale_id) AS units_sold
FROM sales s
LEFT JOIN products p
ON s.product_id= p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY units_sold DESC
```

#### 4. What is the average sales amount per customer in each city?

```sql
SELECT t.city_name, 
	COUNT(DISTINCT s.customer_id) AS total_customer,
	SUM(total) AS total_sales, 
	SUM(total)/COUNT(DISTINCT s.customer_id) AS avg_sales_per_cus
FROM sales s
LEFT JOIN customers c
ON s. customer_id = c.customer_id
LEFT JOIN city t
ON t.city_id= c.city_id
GROUP BY t.city_name
ORDER BY t.city_name 
```

```sql
SELECT x.city_name,x.product_name,x.sales_vol
FROM
(
	SELECT  t.city_name,
			p.product_name,
			COUNT(s.sale_id) AS sales_vol,
			DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY city_name ORDER BY COUNT(s.sale_id) DESC) AS rank
	FROM sales s
	JOIN customers c
	ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
	JOIN city t
	ON t.city_id = c.city_id
	JOIN products p

),
prev_sales AS
(
SELECT *,LAG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY year, month, total_sales DESC) AS prev_sales
FROM month_sales
)
SELECT *, FORMAT((CAST((total_sales - prev_sales) AS NUMERIC(10,2))/ CAST(prev_sales AS NUMERIC (10,2))),'0.00,%') AS growth_percent
FROM prev_sales
WHERE prev_sales IS NOT NULL
```

			t.estimated_rent/COUNT(DISTINCT s.customer_id) AS avg_rent_per_cus
FROM sales s
LEFT JOIN customers c
ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN city t
